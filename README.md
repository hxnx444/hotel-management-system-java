# 🏨 Hotel Management System (Java)

Hey there! 👋 This is a **simple hotel management app** built in **Java**. It’s perfect if you want to see how a small hotel could keep track of bookings, rooms, and guests — all from your computer. Think of it as a tiny, beginner-friendly hotel dashboard.

## 🚀 What It Does

This app helps you:

- 📅 Let guests book rooms  
- 📋 Keep track of who’s staying where  
- 🛏️ Update bookings easily  
- 📊 Give hotel staff a simple view of everything going on  

Basically, it’s the kind of thing a small hotel could use without fancy software.

## 🧠 Cool Stuff Inside

Even though it’s simple, you get to see some important programming concepts in action:

- Managing room bookings and check-ins/check-outs  
- Storing guest info  
- Viewing and editing reservations  
- Keeping an eye on room availability  

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need

- ☕ **Java** (JDK) installed on your computer  
- A **Java IDE** like Eclipse or IntelliJ  
- Optional: A database (MySQL, SQLite, etc.) if you want bookings to save between sessions  

## 📦 How to Try It Out

1. **Grab the code**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hxnx444/hotel-management-system-java
   Open it in your favorite Java IDE

2. Check out the src folder to see how everything works

3. Run the main class (usually Main.java)

4. Play around! Add bookings, check guests in/out, update rooms — have fun exploring

Tip: If there’s a database, look inside the code for connection info or SQL snippets to get it set up.
